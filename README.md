# Calculating differentially expressed features across a trajectory

Included are methods to

-   Calculate the overall feature importance, using
    `calculate_overall_feature_importance`
-   Calculate the importance of a feature at a bifurcation point, using
    `calculate_milestone_feature_importance`

The plotting of the top features is nicely intergrated into
[dynplot](https://github.com/dynverse/dynplot)
