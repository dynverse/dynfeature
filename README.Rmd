# dynfeature

**dynfeature** provides common functionality for extracting relevant features (such as genes) from trajectories

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dynverse/dynfeature.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dynverse/dynfeature)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dynverse/dynfeature/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/dynverse/dynfeature)

Included are methods to

* Calculate the overall feature importance, using `calculate_overall_feature_importance`
* Calculate the importance of a feature at a bifurcation point, using `calculate_milestone_feature_importance`

The plotting of the top features is nicely intergrated into [dynplot](https://github.com/dynverse/dynplot)
